# FFG-SWRPG-CharacterSheet-For-Roll20
Character Sheet for Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars Role Playing Game on Roll20

This project currently consists of 2 parts

* The Character Sheet
* The Associated Script

The Character Sheet is further broken up into two parts

NOTE: This is due to the way that Roll20 accepts character sheets.

* The HTML
* The CSS

The Character Sheet was originally worked on by multiple people throughout its lifespan and now I am attempting to further this endeavor.

With this I have contributed the following:

* I added New Tabs
  * I added a Group Tab
    * This is further broken down into a sub tab for Base of Operations and Shared Resources
      * The Base of Operations section is broken up into the 3 kinds of Bases; Rebel, Business, and Homestead
      * The Shared Resources is for anything that affects the group as a whole and not just the individual character.
  * I added a Companion Tab
    * This is a slightly scaled down version of the main Character tab, but designed to be for a companion type character.
  * The GM sheet (-DicePool) now has a tab!
    * It has a method to roll the Game Mechanics, as well as a way to track the Mechanics of all the Players.
    This makes it easier to write side stories when the Obligation is rolled, so you don't have to ask/look into what their specifics are.
* I cleaned up sections of the old tabs
  * Some tabs have been relabeled
  * Some tabs have been cleaned up / made to make more sense.
  * The Vehicle tab got a dice pool!
* I cleaned up wasted blank spaces
  * There were way way too many blank lines that made the code horrendous to read, these are gone.
* I fixed over 200 coding errors.
  * Open tags with no close tag
  * Closing a tag twice
  * Using code methods wrong
* I am slowly adding in comments for everything that would be useful
  * As I create new sections or copy/edit old sections I am adding in comments to make those easier to find again.
