# FFG-SWRPG-CharacterSheet-For-Roll20
Character Sheet for Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars Role Playing Game on Roll20

This project currently consists of 2 parts

* The Character Sheet
* The Associated Script

The Character Sheet is further broken up into two parts

NOTE: This is due to the way that Roll20 accepts character sheets.

* The HTML
* The CSS

The Character Sheet was originally worked on by multiple people throughout its lifespan and now I am attempting to further this endeavor.

Most recent change;

Added a way for the GM to organize their campaign with additions to the DicePool character sheet.
